# Voice-Based-Customer-Service-Agent

* Have you ever had to wait while calling the customer care service of a company, we all have right, 'the customer care executives are busy so hold the line', so while you are waiting why not get something done.
This project enables you to save time, by implementing an AI-enabled customer assistant, that chats with you while you are holding the line, takes all of your details, looks them up in the customer database, and lets you ask your inquiries to it, regarding your order status and more.
* If your query gets resolved, great otherwise as soon as a service executive becomes available, all your captured details are displayed to him, so along with your inquiry, so that he can start to resolve that, without asking you your details again



* The voice to text module is also attached in the folder and is running, if he system is deployed at a customer service centre, the data from it can be streamed directly to the assistant.

* For running it at your system download all releveant libraries: Flask,Dialogueflow,Pusher,Time,Json,Speach_recognition,gtts,pyaudio,pyttsx3

* As the data we are using can also be used, for business intelligence and decision making processes within the organization, the code for making plots from the data, as well as sample graphs from the data are also attached.
